# JS Functions: Common Utilities

The set of functions, unburdened with the production readiness, perhaps to ease a rapid prototyping in JS itch. Any resemblance with Haskell's `Prelude` is a sordid, vague, although still persued, folly (la folie).

Featurettes:
- *tuple or curry*: permanent curry-former, abandon all tuples
- *decorators*: abuse new syntax via babel support
- *sweets*: JS macros via sweet.js
- methods vs functions *?*, monkey-patching, why yes?
- impl laziness (generators, thunks)

This is a one-utility-per-file collection of JS functions with more weight put on short recursive syntax then on half-notion of production readiness. 'tis a futile attempt at translating Haskell to JS. For practice and exploration, for shits n' giggles. A waste box and probing facility.
