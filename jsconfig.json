exclude
The exclude attribute (a glob pattern) tells the language service what files are not part of your source code.

include
Alternatively, you can explicitly set the files in your project using the include attribute (a glob pattern). If no include attribute is present, then this defaults to including all files in the containing directory and subdirectories. When a include attribute is specified, only those files are included.

compilerOptions
This attribute exists because jsconfig.json is a descendant of tsconfig.json, which is used for compiling TypeScript.

allowJs
Allow JavaScript files to be imported inside your project, instead of just .ts and .tsx files.

checkJs
Works in tandem with allowJs. When checkJs is enabled then errors are reported in JavaScript files. This is the equivalent of including `// @ts-check` at the top of all JavaScript files which are included in your project.




compilerOptions
-------------------

noLib
Do not include the default library file (lib.d.ts)

target
Specifies which default library (lib.d.ts) to use. The values are "es3", "es5", "es6", "es2015", "es2016", "es2017", "es2018", "es2019", "es2020", "esnext".

module
Specifies the module system, when generating module code.
values: "amd", "commonJS", "es2015", "es6", "esnext", "none", "system", "umd"

moduleResolution
Specifies how modules are resolved for imports.
The values are "node" and "classic".

checkJs
Enable type checking on JavaScript files.

experimentalDecorators
Enables experimental support for proposed ES decorators.

allowSyntheticDefaultImports
Allow default imports from modules with no default export.
This does not affect code emit, just type checking.

baseUrl
Base directory to resolve non-relative module names.

paths
Specify path mapping to be computed relative to baseUrl option.
