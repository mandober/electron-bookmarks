This function is called when a contract gets broken and it prints a complaint naming the perpetrator. It makes sure the execution is aborted.

Prints the name of the offender when a contract is broken

Part of the contracts subsystem.
Should pretty print a reason why.
Would be nice to elide printing the stack trace mambo.
If a fn is received that wasn't expected, stringyfy it with toString()
